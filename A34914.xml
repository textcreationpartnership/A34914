            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore ſtay a little and conſider, honeſtly in the ſight of God let us reaſon together; for what cauſe is it think you the Lord hath brought you into
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40869:2"/>
power and exalted you? is it becauſe the Lord hath a love to you more than any other? or is it becauſe the Lord is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with your doings? or is it becauſe your Righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds theirs, that are rejected and caſt out before you? let that which is juſt in all your conſciences judg, and anſwer me, whether it be for all, or any of theſe things forementioned, if it be, then what means all theſe abominations which are of late excerciſed? and (as it were) free toleration of them? for there is no reſtraint at all by any man in power (high or low) laid upon them; but the Flood-gates, or rather the Hell-gates of wickedneſs are opened wide, truly it is very hard to he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ſeveral wickedneſſes committed, as Stage-plays, and other plays, Bear-baiting, Bul-baiting, leading the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures up and down the ſtreets, dreſt with Bells and Ribons, &amp; Bag-pipes playing before them, multitudes of men, women and children following them, leaping, ſhouting, and rejoycing, now this is publikely done to the amazement of all that fear the Lord; and the private wickedneſſe is exceeding hard to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, as Drunkenneſſe, Whoring, Thieving, Murthering, Revelling, Blaſpheming God, Scoffing, and Deriding all that fear him: When I have beheld many of theſe things, my heart hath even melted within me, to conſider the end of them, for truly I muſt bear my Teſtimony, (in the fear of the Lord) that the tenth part of the wickedneſs now committed, was not committed in the time of the fore-going Power, though the Lords controverſy is with them, and he hath brought them to Judgment: Therefore ſee, ſearch and read, this is my advice, if your Righteouſneſs exceeds not their's, you can in no wiſe eſcape the Judgment of God, who is Juſt, and renders to every one according to their doings, and if the hypocrite be brought to Judgment (who ſaid and did not) what will become of the open prophane (read with that of God in you) and then you will underſtand; for I tell you the ſin of the hypocrite and the ſin of the open prophane, is all abomination in the ſight of God, and for judgment, though (it may be) the ſtroak may be heavier upon the one, then upon the other; read I ſay, and then you will know your Condition, and think not, that in this day the returning to your abominable broth and Swins fleſh, which

the Lord ſpued out many years ſince, will be an acceptable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in this day of the Lords great Manifeſtation and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, who is riſen in great might and Power, to confound and daſh in pieces, root up, conſume and burn, whatſoever the Heavenly God hath not planted, for into the fire muſt it be caſt, which burneth for ever.</p>
            <p>And you who are the Miniſters of this, which the Lords curſe is to, <hi>wo, wo,</hi> from the Lord is your portion, and better it had been <hi>you had never been born then to grieve</hi> Gods good Spirit in you, and all his children by doing that which the witneſſe of God in you condemns for: Oh you prophets of wine and ſtrong drink, have you been hid in the earth theſe many years, &amp; are you now moved out of your holes? <hi>if your worſhip were the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Spirit, then where hath been your Teſtimony all this while? The true Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel who ſpeak by the ſpirit of God, concluded <hi>woe</hi> to themſelves, if they preached not the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> it was not the powers of the earth could ſilence them, but they were obedient to Gods commands, but dumb Idoll Shepheards have you been and ſo you are: And think not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have the Powers of the Nation on your ſide, that your wares will come to a better Market than your Anceſtors (if ſo good) for the day is dawned and the Sun is riſen, which is the <hi>Light</hi> in thouſands of men and women, and hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Marchant of <hi>Babylon</hi> with his deceitful wares, ſo that no more of them will be bought of you for ever, glory to God and Immortal praiſes of all his be given for ever and ever, who hath made bare your skirts, and ſo appears your ſhame and nakedneſs to all; And as to your long Robes, Veſtures, and Girdles, you flutter up and down the ſtreets in, you find nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rule nor example in Scripture of any of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that wore ſuch for diſtinction, yet there were ſuch <hi>as wore long Garments,</hi> but they were deceivers, and know <hi>this is your Figure which you wear,</hi> you dumb and ſpeechleſs, do you intrude into the houſe of the good Man, to the ſupper which he hath prepared? you are by him found dumb, and he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt you to be bound hand and foot, and to be caſt into utter darkneſs, this is your ſentence from the Lord, and the type of your Girdles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40869:3"/>And as to the Power that gives you life and vigour in this thing, I ſay, a day is given them (though it be a day) as in Winter, yet a work they have to do for the Lord, who hath ordained them as a Rod, and a Scourge to chaſtiſe his people by, and hath filled them (as a Vyal) with his wrath, which is to be powred upon that Spirit that hath dealt treacherouſly, and rebelled againſt Gods manifeſtation, and ſo juſt it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath appointed it, and when the Rod hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and he that appointeth it ſaith it is enough, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire ſhall it be caſt. Therefore conſider what you are, and how you are in the hand of the Lord, for aſſuredly the Lord will plead with the Rulers and Prieſts of this Nation, and a day of howling and bitter lamentation is to you, inſtead of your joy and pleaſures which you ſo eagerly purſue; and was it not better for you to repent of the evil in your ſelves, and then make laws for the ſuppreſſing it in others, which if it was truly done, from the principle of God in you, it might put a ſtop, or at leaſt, ſet bounds to this floud of wickedneſs, which in theſe few months paſt hath over-flowed this Nation; for which cauſe the Lords fierce wrath is kindled againſt it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept true repentance be made manifeſt from you with amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, he will certainly excecute his vengeance upon you, and who ſhall defend and deliver you? it is not your arme of fleſh (you ſo much boaſt of) can do it, for they have been tryed by men, and have ſeveral times fallen into the hands of men; <hi>but it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Lord,</hi> if ſo, who ſhall deliver? for ſtrong is the Lord who Judges: And know that Gods Judgments came upon the foregoing Powers, becauſe they laid weights and burdens heavy to be born upon the ſeed of God whereſoever it did appear, and Impriſoned many of the Servants of the Lord, becauſe for conſcience ſake they could not conform to the worlds vain and wicked cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes, and becauſe they could not for Conſcience ſake pay Tithes, to maintaine the National Hireling-Belly-Prieſts, theſe things with many other, they ſought occaſion by, to Perſecute, and Impriſon the Innocent Lambs of Chriſt Jeſus, and would be Lords over the conſciences of men, which thing is accurſed of the Lord; <hi>for it is not the Place or Duty of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40869:4"/>
any Magiſtrate whatſoever, or any other, to impoſe any thing upon the Conſcience of any;</hi> for the Lord alone is he that doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the conſcience. Now I know you will own the ſaying in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>do unto every man as you would be done unto your ſelves,</hi> and if you practiſe the ſame you will allow us the ſame liberty as you your ſelves have, that is, not to be forced to this way of worſhip, or the other, or any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever which concerns conſcience; for you your ſelves would not be ſo ſerved; And I tell you plain we challenge the ſame liberty, as you enjoy as to matter of Worſhip and Religion, and if we be debarred of it, the Lord God, that pleads our cauſe, will give us it whether you will or nay. For I know that your Church and Religion (as you call it) cannot be ſettled without perſecution; and truly I believe unto death; but the Scriptures muſt be fulfilled where there was a generation ſaid, <hi>had we lived</hi> in the <hi>Prophets dayes, we would not have put them to death;</hi> but the ſame generation put <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>great Prophet to death,</hi> and ſo you will ſay now, had we lived in <hi>Queen Maryes days</hi> we would not have put the people of God to death, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdome; yet impriſon and perſecute them now, though not by open burning, becauſe your day is not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come; ſo you manifeſt your ſelves to be of the ſame ſeed upon which all the righteous blood hath been charged, from <hi>Abel</hi> even to this day; ſo one ſeed, the Perſecutor; one ſeed perſecuted; the one of <hi>Cain</hi> from all generations, the other of <hi>Abell</hi> from all generations; ſo now read your ſelves of one of theſe ſeeds; for of one of them aſſuredly you are, and your fruits declare the ſeed, your ſelves you cannot hide from the Witneſſe of God in your own conſciences, neither from it in ours: Therefore make not <hi>your finger</hi> as heavy as <hi>their Loynes</hi> that the Lord hath caſt out before you; for as your ſins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds theirs, ſo will your judgement exceed theirs, for juſt is the Lord; And further know that the Lord is <hi>cutting his work ſhort in righteouſneſſe in the earth,</hi> and is quick and ſwift in his jugdements, therefore think not your foundation is more ſure then thoſe that are gone before you, when the Lord comes to plead with you for your abominations; did you never take notice how thick the changes of Government have been in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40869:4"/>
this Nation of late years? And what think you of it? Was it only to make room for you? If you think ſo, you are highly miſtaken: Now had your power been more righteous, more juſt, more holy, and more for freedom, and liberty then thoſe that are gone, then I ſhould have both believed and confeſſed that the Lord onely in love ordered the Government to you, and eſtabliſhed your Throne; for righteouſneſſe, holyneſſe, meekneſſe, equity, freedom and liberty in matters of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Lord God ownes and loves; and it is <hi>that</hi> he will ſet up in the earth, in deſpite of all that oppoſes it; Therefore in vain it is, <hi>Oh Rod of Gods wrath,</hi> to contend with him in whoſe hands thou art, for aſſuredly Gods juſtice will take hold on thee, and know alſo that thy reward and wages thou haſt, and ſhalt have at the hand of the Lord; for thy ſervice is thy pleaſures and delights to the full ſatisfaction of thy deſire; and what canſt, thou have more, <hi>thou Rod of Gods Juſtice?</hi> Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ſenſe of him who hath appointed thee; This is for thy ſervice; For <hi>Iſraels</hi> Rod was appointed of the Lord, and for his ſervice he had the ſpoile of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Land, and this honour was he honoured withall; but there was a time when he was had in remembrance with the Lord, and was called to an account, and then into the fire was he caſt; read and conſider; I do not ſpeake theſe things in contempt of your power, or in upbraiding you concerning theſe things which I have mentioned, Rulers, or Prieſts, the Lord is my witneſſe; for I am ſubject unto it for conſcience ſake; but my Spirit is grieved within me and my ſoul vexed and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened to ſee the abomination and wickedneſſe exalted in ſo high a meaſure, ſince the comming in of this Power; truly this City of <hi>London</hi> is as ripe for fire and brimſtone, from Heaven, as <hi>Sodom</hi> was; for fulneſſe of bread and idleneſſe was <hi>Sodoms</hi> ſin; conſider what is the great ſin of this City, is it not ſo that the greateſt part of her Inhabitants knows hardly what to eat and what to drink, or what to put on? is this the end of plenty? or doth this anſwer the end of him that gives it? ſurely it is given to ſerve the neceſſity, and not the unlimited luſt; caſt your eyes abroad in the Creation, and ſee if every creature doth not condemn your ſelves; for I know not one

creature, that doth not anſwer the end of his Creation, but man; and ſo the good creatures of God will riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt you in the day of the Lord; conſider theſe things in the dread of the Lord, oh ye Rulers and Magiſtrates, for it lyeth at your doores, before the Lord hath ſealed his Decree which is gone out againſt you, which is near at hand to be done for the Lord hath purpoſed it, and your condition calls for it, and remember you are warned by one, who ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the ſeed of God in you, which is held in ſtrong bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, under the particulars above mentioned.</p>
